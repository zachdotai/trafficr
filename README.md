# trafficr

### Context

This repo contains code that can be used to setup a batch job in Python to collect the average speeds on a predefined interval across major roads in Kuwait. 

The average speed information can be used to estimate the traffic flow across the respective roads which can be helpful in conducting research of urban traffic flow and its impact on the environment.

The project includes the Python script that can be used as a cronjob with your Google Maps API to collect the average speeds and store in a NoSQL database (Firebase) service, the script that extracts the data from the NoSQL database to convert into csv format for data manipulation, modelling, and analysis afterwards, the requirements file for the scripts to work on your local machine, and the data collected.
